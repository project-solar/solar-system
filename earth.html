  <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.</li>
  <li>About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. </li>
  <li>Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.</li>
  <li> Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years.</li>
  <li> Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.</li>
</ul>
